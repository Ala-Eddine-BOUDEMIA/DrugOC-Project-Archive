This repository serves as a detailed summary of my role and contributions to the **DrugOC** project.

The official code is managed by the **[Google Developer Student Club - ENSB Organization](https://github.com/DSC-ENSB/DRUGOC-project)**, of which I was a founding member.

## The Problem: The Burden of Adverse Drug Events

Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) are a major public health issue. However, reporting these events is often a slow and complex process for healthcare professionals. The goal of DrugOC was to create a modern, digital tool to streamline this process, improving the quality and speed of pharmacovigilance.

## The Core Challenge: Automating the French Imputability Method

The heart of the project was to digitally implement the official French method for causality assessment. The system I architected needed to calculate three distinct scores:

1.  **Informative Score (SI):** A preliminary score (NI0-NI2) to assess the quality of the available data for each case.
2.  **Intrinsic Imputability (I-Score):** The core clinical score based on chronological and semiological criteria.
3.  **Extrinsic Imputability (B-Score):** A bibliographic score (B1-B4) that quantifies whether the adverse event is already documented in scientific literature.

## My Role & Contributions

The DrugOC project was born from a real-world problem I identified during my pharmacovigilance internship at the **[Centre National de Pharmacovigilance et de Matériovigilance (CNPM)](https://cnpm.org.dz/)**. There, I developed a standalone Python prototype to semi-automate this complex assessment method.

When I brought this concept to the Google DSC chapter, my role evolved from solo developer to **Product & Technical Lead**.

*   **Spearheaded the Initiative:** Championed the project from a personal prototype into the team's flagship entry for the Google Solution Challenge.
*   **Architected the Core Logic:** My primary responsibility was to translate the complex clinical rules of the Imputability Method into a clear technical specification for our development team.
*   **Coordinated a Cross-Functional Team:** Worked with front-end, back-end, design, and communication members to ensure the final product was robust and clinically accurate.

This collaborative work resulted in the project being recognized as one of the **Top 20 solutions globally** and **Top 5 in the MENA region** in the 2020 Google DSC Solution Challenge.
